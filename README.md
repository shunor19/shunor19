- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @shunor19
- I learn web-programming and software-development as well.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating responsive websites by using FlexBox or Grid or Bootstrap. I just started learning JaveScript. 
- I'd rather be in the world of web-development, I haven't decided about which part of the web (Frontend/Backend) but I like to do programming as well.
